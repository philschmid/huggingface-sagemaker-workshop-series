    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html) is a purpose-built inference option that makes it easy for you to deploy and scale ML models. Serverless Inference is ideal for workloads which have idle periods between traffic spurts and can tolerate cold starts. Serverless endpoints automatically launch compute resources and scale them in and out depending on traffic, eliminating the need to choose instance types or manage scaling policies. This takes away the undifferentiated heavy lifting of selecting and managing servers. Serverless Inference integrates with AWS Lambda to offer you high availability, built-in fault tolerance and automatic scaling.\n",
